# `devel+classic`

This branch forks the upstream `devel` (default) branch, adding support for the Ethereum Classic network.

## Implementation

#### File naming
- Added `*_test.go` files are named `classic_*_test.go`. Go test files must have the `_test.go` suffix.
- Added `*.go` files are named `*_classic.go`
